 *This is a message sent as a qt signal. the idea is to collect all of the settings of the gui
 *in this struct, then send as a signal argument. it can be used for all the signals in the system
 *to keep design simple. This info will be translated into MPI messages sent between processes.
 * Put whatever you want as fields.

// this struct will be sent over mpi as a byte stream.
// also it is sent as a signal.slot etc.
// all this stuff reflects what is on the user interface. We collect all uiser interface
// settings, and put into a message that can be a signal.
